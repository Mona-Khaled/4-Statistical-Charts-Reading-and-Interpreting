Statistical charts are used to represent statistical data in visual form. One of the most used statistical  
charts is the **Bar chart** which presents categorical data with rectangular bars of heights proportional  
to the values that they represent. **Pie charts** are also used Sometimes to illustrate numerical proportions.  
Interpreting such charts visually may not produce an accurate results. In this application, statistical charts  
are interpreted and information are extracted  from them programmatically. Given an image that contains a statistical  
chart and the color of each category (i.e. legend), program should extract statistical information in a textual form.
